with the most dominant main food commodity is rice, 
while other minor commodities are corn, peanuts and sweet potatoes. 
Agricultural produce in Sumatera Island is highly vulnerable to climate change and its negative impacts can affect 
cropping patterns, planting time, production and yield quality. 
Moreover, the increase in the earth's temperature due to the impact of global warming which will affect 
the pattern of precipitation, evaporation, water-run off, soil moisture, and climate variations which are very fluctuating 
as a whole can threaten the success of agricultural production.
